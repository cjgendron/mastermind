            <h2>Welcome to Mastermind Solver!</h2>
            <h5 class="subheader">Background:</h5>
            <p>
                There are 32768 possible patterns that can be created in a game of Ultimate Mastermind, which has 5
                spaces, and 8 possible colors in each space.  When a player guesses a pattern, that pattern, when
                compared to a prior guess, must yield the same result of red and white pegs as the solution pattern for
                it to be a valid guess.  This solver uses that approach to rapidly solve via brute force for the proper
                pattern.

                The solver begins by generating all 32768 patterns and giving the user a guess.  The first guess is
                somewhat arbitrary, and in this case is hard coded to Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue.  As the user
                enters the red/white peg counts, the system continuously filters the list of possible patterns by
                removing patterns that would not yield those same counts when compared against the prior guess.

            <div class="row">
                <ol class="small-offset-1 small-10 columns">
                    <li>Enter the displayed "guess" into your actual game of Mastermind.</li>
                    <li>Enter the number of red and white pegs that the guess received</li>
                    <li>Click "Guess"</li>
                    <li>Repeat until your guess is the right answer</li>

            <div class="row">

                    <li>
                        As the number of possible answers decreases, the chances that the displayed guess is the correct
                        pattern increases
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the number of possible answers is 1, then the displayed guess MUST be the correct pattern
                        - if it isn't then you either entered your guess incorrectly into the actual game or there is an
                        error in the number of red and white pegs from a prior guess
                    </li>
                    <li>If the number of possible answers is 0, then there MUST be an error in a prior guess</li>
                </ol>
